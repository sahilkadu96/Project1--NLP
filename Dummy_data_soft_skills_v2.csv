listening,"Listening is one of the most important aspects of communication. 
Successful listening is not just about understanding spoken or written information but also an understanding of how the speaker feels during communication.
If a speaker can see and feel that someone is listening and understanding, that can help build a stronger, deeper relationship between interlocutors.
Careful listening can also create an environment in which everyone feels safe to express ideas, opinions, and feelings or plan and solve problems in a creative way."
listening,"Empathy is the ability to understand the feelings, thoughts, and beliefs of another person. 
Exactly this is the reason why organizations have started developing empathy in the workplace.
Emotional acceptance, closely related to empathy, means that, after empathizing and understanding how other person feels, we can accept the reasons why somebody feels or thinks the way they do, regardless of whether we agree with it or not.
Try to see things from others’ perspectives by accepting what you hear instead of trying to fix things and solve the problem."
listening,"The way to improve your listening skills is to practice active listening.
This is where you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, the complete message being communicated.
In order to do this, you must pay attention to the other person very carefully.
You cannot allow yourself to become distracted by whatever else may be going on around you, or by forming counterarguments while the other person is still speaking.
Nor can you allow yourself to get bored, and lose focus on what the other person is saying.
"
listening,"Listening is the ability to accurately receive and interpret messages in the communication process.
Listening is key to all effective communication. 
Without the ability to listen effectively, messages are easily misunderstood.
As a result, communication breaks down and the sender of the message can easily become frustrated or irritated.
If there is one communication skill you should aim to master, then listening is it.

"
speaking,"Conversation is the basis of communication, and one must not neglect its importance.
Even a simple, friendly conversation with colleagues can build mutual trust and even detect problems before they become serious.
A healthy dose of chatting with an unknown person can lead to a business opportunity. 
Be accessible and friendly because then you will be able to talk to almost anyone."
speaking,"Communication begins with you. 
Take responsibility and start communication, do not wait and expect another person to do so, and don’t hide behind various forms of online communication.
Good communication, especially on important topics, requires far more than what we can express in a written message.
We often misunderstand this kind of communication because we do not see the person’s face, its nonverbal communication, and in what circumstances communication starts.
"
speaking,"Think before you speak. 
Most of us work best when we have time to process our own thoughts before we share them.
If the conversation or meeting is worth your precious time, take a few minutes to prepare the speech draft.
For a very important conversation, try a mock-up conversation with a trusted person so you can get rid of any potential mistakes."
speaking,"As you formulate a speech strategy, put yourself in the position of a person who will listen to you.
This will ensure a balanced approach and you will be prepared to learn and defend potential disagreements and it will be easier for you to defend your standpoint.
No one can predict with certainty how other people will react.
Improve chances of a successful conversation by expecting negative answers and queries. 
So it is harder for your listeners to catch you unprepared."
non-verbal communication,"When we talk about things that matter to us, then we send a lot of nonverbal messages.
Non-verbal signals are wordless communication, body position, facial expression, hand movements, gestures, eye contact, attitude and tone of your voice, muscle tension, and the way you/we breathe.
The way you look, listen, create, react, gesture speaks far more about feelings than words will ever be able to.
Why non-verbal communication skills are important?
Developing the ability to understand others and use nonverbal signals will help you connect with others, express what you think, meet challenging situations, and build better relationships at home and at work."
non-verbal communication,"Nonverbal communication, also called manual language, is the process of sending and receiving messages without using words, either spoken or written.
Similar to the way that italicizing emphasizes written language, nonverbal behavior may emphasize parts of a verbal message.
"
non-verbal communication,"Nonverbal communication plays an important role in how we convey meaning and information to others, as well as how we interpret the actions of those around us.
The important thing to remember when looking at nonverbal behaviors is to consider the actions in groups. 
Consider what a person says verbally, combined with their expressions, appearance, and tone of voice and it can tell you a great deal about what that person is really trying to say.
"
stress management,"In small quantities, stress can be very useful and encouraging for work. 
However, when the stress becomes constant and completely begins to take effect, it can affect communication, clarity of opinion, and appropriate behavior and action.
When you are under stress you may misunderstand other people, send confusing nonverbal signals, and use funny patterns of behavior.
How often did you feel stressed during a discussion with your friends or colleagues and then say or did something you regretted later?
If you improve stress management skills, not only will you avoid these subsequent regrets, but you will also be able to influence the other person you are entering into a conflict."
stress management,"If you’re living with high levels of stress, you’re putting your entire well-being at risk. 
Stress wreaks havoc on your emotional equilibrium, as well as your physical health. 
It narrows your ability to think clearly, function effectively, and enjoy life. 
It may seem like there’s nothing you can do about stress. 
The bills won’t stop coming, there will never be more hours in the day, and your work and family responsibilities will always be demanding. 
But you have a lot more control than you might think.
"
stress management,"Effective stress management helps you break the hold stress has on your life, so you can be happier, healthier, and more productive. 
The ultimate goal is a balanced life, with time for work, relationships, relaxation, and fun—and the resilience to hold up under pressure and meet challenges head on. 
But stress management is not one-size-fits-all. 
That’s why it’s important to experiment and find out what works best for you. 
The following stress management tips can help you do that.

"
emotion control,"In communication, feelings play an important role. Making decisions more often affects the way you feel than the way you think.
Guided by emotions, your nonverbal behavior affects the understanding of other people and how others understand and perceive you.
If you are not aware of your feelings you are guided, you will not be able to express your needs and experiences.
This can result in frustration, misunderstanding, and conflict.
Control of emotions provides you with tools to understand others, yourself, and the messages you send.
Though recognizing feelings makes it simple, many people have a strong feeling like anger, sorrow, or fear of being pushed under the carpet."
emotion control,"Emotional control is the ability to identify and regulate your emotions and respond in a socially tolerable and flexible way and also have a certain level of control over spontaneous reactions.
Emotional control encompasses both positive and negative emotions, however, it usually refers to attempts by an individual to manage the generation, expression or experience of particularly disruptive emotions and impulses that can have negative consequences. 
This is thought to be done through the use of cognitive or behavioural strategies.
"
emotion control,"Emotional control can be seen as a modifier. 
It helps us filter the most important information and allows us to attend or interact with it in a way that doesn’t provoke negative emotions, like stress. Researchers believe that the way we feel and interpret our emotions affects the way we think, our decision-making skills and how we generally co-ordinate our day-to-day lives. 
A well-regulated individual is likely to have better balance, judgement and control over their emotions and therefore their actions. 
They will be able to more accurately judge which situations to embrace and which to avoid.

"
mail,"If you can keep an email to less than 2 or 3 sentences, it’s much easier to read it right then.
If your email is longer than a paragraph or two, people will often put off reading it and it will probably take you longer to get a response.
"
mail,"It’s easier to read emails that are broken down into one or two sentences per paragraph than long paragraphs.
"
mail,"Nothing drives people crazier than an email where someone sends over a lot of information but doesn’t say what they’d like you to do. 
I often respond to those immediately by asking: What do you want me to do?
Do you want me introduce you to someone?
Do you want me to read your blog post and give you feedback?
Do you want me to respond with whether I’ll be able to attend an event? Be clear and say it explicitly up front.
"
mail,"It’s so easy these days to send off an email in 30 seconds that would take someone over an hour to respond to.
Please don’t tell me to go to your startup’s website and give you feedback. 
To actually give your product or website a thorough review and analyze it in a way that is useful actually takes a lot of work.
If I can respond to something in less than two minutes, I’ll do it immediately.
What do you want feedback on? The business model? The color of your button? The text? Be specific and reasonable.

"
decision making,"We tend to believe that the things we do will work out for us, and therefore we have a bias toward action.
This means that we sometimes make changes that don’t need to be made and create complications where none are needed.
"
decision making,"Also known as the “status-quo bias,” self-interest bias is when we have a tendency to like and expect things to stay the same.
Deep down, we prefer the world to match our perception of how we think things work.
"
decision making,"As humans, we love patterns. Patterns are comfortable. They make us feel like there is sense and order in the world.
As a result, we have a tendency to imagine patterns where none actually exist.
"
decision making,"Our tendency is to stick with the herd, go with the flow, and generally stay out of other people’s way.
We’d love it if we could rise to the top of the pack, but very few of us are willing to ruffle feathers in order to get there.
"
decision making,"Most of us work nine-to-five jobs, because we are uncomfortable with the prospect of working for ourselves and not knowing where our next paycheck is coming from.
While this isn’t always the case for designers, we still favor stability in many ways.
It’s why we always order the same things at our go-to restaurants and stay in the town where we grew up.
"
decision making,"Technical decision making isn’t so much about which tool to pick than what problem to solve. Once the problem space has been well defined, then evaluating the possible solutions becomes a lot easier.
Having a solid grasp of the problem one actually needs solving can be a lot harder than one might acknowledge, especially so when a large number of well-evangelized “solutions” are up for grabs.
"
decision making,"What’s particularly challenging about deciding what problem to solve is prioritization. 
At any given time, there is probably a laundry list of things that are “broken” or suboptimal. 
Prioritization becomes easy when we have a full understanding of all the problems we’re trying to rank in order of priority.
"
decision making,"Patterns are comfortable. They make us feel like there is sense and order in the world.
As a result, we have a tendency to imagine patterns where none actually exist.
"
decision making,"If you struggled with decision-making before, living entirely within the walls of your home probably hasn’t made things any easier. 
Everyone’s chronic indecision looks a little different: Maybe you have a fear of responsibility.
Or maybe you’re a perfectionist, and the idea of making the wrong decision sends your anxiety through the roof.
Whatever it looks like, it’s frustrating when your own brain holds you in limbo: You can see all the possible paths laid out ahead, but you’re frozen in front of them.
"
decision making,"Preparation is key for doing well at whatever it is you’re trying to do.
It’s why athletes practice, actors rehearse, and writers read.
The reason preparation is so critical is that it conditions your mind and body to perform in situations where others are not so conditioned.
But the real power in preparation lies in how preparation makes you more likely to perform well.
"
decision making,"Implicit in any decision is the belief that the option you choose has the highest probability of working out better for you than the options you don’t choose.
Therefore, even if you aren’t explicitly thinking about the set of possibilities, your preferences, and the probabilities, you are still making these estimates.
"
decision making,"Optimizing your instinctual decision-making isn’t easy. But it is the next step in you evolution, and reaching the next version of yourself depends on its mastery.

The repetition will become tedious. You will want to give up.
But mastering yourself requires strict diligence, brutal honesty, and intense focus on your journey.
"
decision making,"Separating getting clarify on the proposal, giving everyone an opportunity to be heard (react) and dealing with material objections into three separate activities.
They address three separate needs for the people who are engaging with the proposal and deal with each one separately.
"
decision making,"Defining a valid objection as something that would “cause harm or move us backward”. 
This is typically where consensus-based decision making tends to fail.
And also somewhat related to Fred Wilson’s recent post on satisficing — by setting an agreed-upon acceptable threshold for proposals, we can avoid some of the major pitfalls that cause important decision-making processes to stall.
"
relationship building,"Your actions, not words, demonstrate a desire to learn about someone."
relationship building,"Whenever possible, use reversals to gather information and keep the conversation focused on them."
relationship building,Use that knowledge to point out the greatness they never knew they possessed.
conversation,"What I seem to notice, increasingly, is the poor quality of conversations today.
Perhaps the ubiquity of social media, texting and digital communication has made us all impatient, distracted, rude conversationalists. 
We tend to talk at one another rather than with one another.
"
conversation,"How people converse tells you a lot about them. Egocentric people like everything to be about them, so they steer conversations back to their favorite topic: themselves.
Shy, reserved people tend to listen more, but also fail to jump in and share. 
As a result, they get steamrolled in conversations.
Boisterous, overconfident people think they know everything and interrupt frequently to share their “brilliance.”
Insecure people sometimes play the “one-upmanship” game, needing to go one better than whatever your accomplishment or success might have been.
"
conversation,"What follows are some helpful guidelines to improve your conversations.
Learn and employ these tips, and watch what happens. 
You may find people seeking you out more for coffee, lunch or just to talk.
People will start speaking highly of you, as someone who really listens and converses well.
"
conversation,"Some people just have to do you one better.
Mention your promotion at work, and they’ll have to tell you about theirs, and why it’s more remarkable.
Talk about how proud you are of your kid, and they’ll mention something better about their kid.
It’s a twisted kind of insecurity. Like they have to compete with you.

"
time management,"Time management is the ability to use your time productively and efficiently. 
You could also think of it as the art of having time to do everything that you need, without feeling stressed about it.
It sounds simple, but it is much harder in practice. This page explains some of the principles behind good time management.
"
time management,"Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done?
It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritising your time.
"
time management,"This distinction between urgent and important is the key to prioritising your time and your workload, whether at work, at home or when studying.
It enables you to work out what to do first, and what can be left either until later, or not done at all.
For example, if you leave an urgent but unimportant task, you may find that it becomes unnecessary.
